# EFI-Machinist-MR9A-Pro-Max-XEON-E5-2696-V3-RX6600M

SMBIOS iMacPro1,1

USB Type-A 2.0 and 3.0 ports fully mapped and ready to use with macOS Ventura (and older).
If you use a Fenvi HB1200 (or other compatible WiFi card), you'll need to map its Internal Bluetooth usb port.

Need to generate your own SMBIOS for serial numbers, because those lines are XXXXXXXX'd in this config.plist

^^ Enjoy 😎🤙 ^^
