Platform: Desktop | Intel X99
Motherboard: Machinist MR9A Pro Max
Processor: Intel Xeon E5-2696v3 2.3GHz 18C/36T
GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600M 8GB GDDR6
Audio: Realtek ALC897 codec
LAN: Realtek's Gigabit Ethernet
SMBIOS: iMacPro1,1
macOS: MacOs Ventura 13.2.1 (compatible with previous versions, if needed, by adjusting the config.plist file)
Opencore: 0.9.0

USB Type-A 2.0 and 3.0 ports fully mapped and ready to use with macOS Ventura (or older).
If you use a Fenvi HB1200 (or other compatible WiFi card), you'll need to map its Internal Bluetooth usb port.

Need to generate your own SMBIOS for serial numbers, because those lines are XXXXXXXX'd in the config.plist

^^ Enjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™ ^^
