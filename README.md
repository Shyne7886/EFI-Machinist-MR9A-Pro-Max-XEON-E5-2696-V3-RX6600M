USB Type-A 2.0 and 3.0 ports fully mapped and ready to use with macOS Ventura (and older).
If you use a Fenvi HB1200 (or other compatible WiFi card), you'll need to map its Internal Bluetooth usb port.

Need to generate your own SMBIOS because those lines are XXXXXXXX'd in this config.plist

^^ Enjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™ ^^
