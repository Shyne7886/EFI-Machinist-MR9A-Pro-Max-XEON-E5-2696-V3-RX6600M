Platform: Desktop | Intel X99

Motherboard: Machinist MR9A Pro Max

Processor: Intel Xeon E5-2696v3 2.3GHz 18C/36T

GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600M 8GB GDDR6

Audio: Realtek ALC897 codec

LAN: Realtek's RTL8111 Gigabit Ethernet

SMBIOS: iMacPro1,1

macOS: MacOs Sonoma/Sequoia (compatible with previous versions, if needed, by adjusting the config.plist file)
Opencore: 1.0.2

USB ports fully mapped.
  - I recommend you remap them, as your board's USB controllers may be different.
  - Also if you use a Fenvi HB1200 or other compatible Broadcom WiFi card, you'll to map its USB internal port.

Need to generate your own SMBIOS for serial numbers, because those lines are XXXXXXXX'd in the config.plist

^^ Enjoy ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤™ ^^
